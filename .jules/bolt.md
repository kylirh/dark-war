## 2026-08-26 - O(n) array splicing during level population

**Learning:** `spawnLevelEntities` and friends drew a random tile from a
`freeTiles` pool and removed it with `freeTiles.splice(index, 1)`. The pool
holds one entry per walkable tile (a few thousand on a 128x96 dungeon), and
`splice` shifts every element after the hole, so each spawn was O(n).

**Action:** Replaced it with swap-and-pop (`pool[i] = pool[pool.length - 1];
pool.pop()`), which is O(1). Safe because the pool is only ever sampled
uniformly at random, so the reordering is unobservable.

**Caveat worth recording:** measured, this is worth roughly 30 microseconds
per level generation - ~60 spawns against a ~5k pool. It is asymptotic
hygiene and a readability win once factored into one helper, not a fix for a
measured bottleneck. Do not cite it as one.
