## 2026-09-01 - Document worldX/worldY as authoritative

**What was found:** The `CLAUDE.md` and `.jules/prompts/scribe.md` explicitly noted that `worldX`/`worldY` are the authoritative source of truth and `gridX`/`gridY` are derived and read-only, but the actual TSDoc comments on `GameEntity` and `BaseEntity` just stated "Read-only grid X coordinate derived from worldX" and "World X coordinate in pixels" without enforcing the constraint or fully explaining the _why_.

**Action:** Updated the TSDoc comments in `src/engine/entities/game-entity.ts` and `src/engine/types.ts` to explicitly state that `worldX`/`worldY` are the "authoritative source of truth" and added instructions to `gridX`/`gridY` to "Do not assign this; mutate {@link worldX} instead". Made `gridX` and `gridY` `readonly` in the `BaseEntity` interface so the TypeScript compiler enforces the read-only contract.

**Prevention:** Future modifications to entity coordinates must mutate the `worldX`/`worldY` properties. Rely on TypeScript's `readonly` modifier in interfaces to enforce constraints that runtime getters provide.

## 2026-09-04 - Document GameState.entities immutability contract

**What was found:** The `GameState.entities` array property was exposed in `src/engine/types.ts` without any TSDoc warning callers not to mutate it directly. As `CLAUDE.md` specifies, all entity lifecycle modifications (adds/removes) must route through `EntityManager` (via `state.entityManager`) because direct array mutations silently desync physics bodies, network deltas, and derived caches. This is an invisible constraint that had previously caused state sync bugs.

**Action:** Added a TSDoc comment directly to `entities: Entity[];` in `GameState` explaining the contract and pointing developers to `{@link entityManager}`, naming the three things a direct `push`/`splice`/`filter`/reassignment desyncs: the id and item lookup indexes, the physics bodies `Physics.syncEntityBodies` reconciles from spawn/remove diffs, and the per-entity network deltas built from those same diffs. Promoted the neighbouring `//` note on `entityManager` to TSDoc so the pair reads consistently and both surface in IntelliSense.

**Prevention:** Future developers checking IntelliSense on `state.entities` will now see the requirement to use `EntityManager` for mutations. Document a contract on the property where the mistake is made, not only on the class that enforces it — a `//` comment on the neighbouring property does not reach the hover.
