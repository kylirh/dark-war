## 2026-09-01 - Document worldX/worldY as authoritative

**What was found:** The `CLAUDE.md` and `.jules/prompts/scribe.md` explicitly noted that `worldX`/`worldY` are the authoritative source of truth and `gridX`/`gridY` are derived and read-only, but the actual TSDoc comments on `GameEntity` and `BaseEntity` just stated "Read-only grid X coordinate derived from worldX" and "World X coordinate in pixels" without enforcing the constraint or fully explaining the _why_.

**Action:** Updated the TSDoc comments in `src/engine/entities/game-entity.ts` and `src/engine/types.ts` to explicitly state that `worldX`/`worldY` are the "authoritative source of truth" and added instructions to `gridX`/`gridY` to "Do not assign this; mutate {@link worldX} instead". Made `gridX` and `gridY` `readonly` in the `BaseEntity` interface so the TypeScript compiler enforces the read-only contract.

**Prevention:** Future modifications to entity coordinates must mutate the `worldX`/`worldY` properties. Rely on TypeScript's `readonly` modifier in interfaces to enforce constraints that runtime getters provide.
