**Merged:** #283 `test(simulation): cover monster self-healing interval and hp cap` —
`selfHeals` had no coverage; mutation-checked (interval and hpMax cap each fail
the test when broken). #282 `refactor(simulation): consolidate deterministic
command sorting` — the two comparators were byte-identical, so the extraction is
behavior-preserving. #281 `docs(adr): propose data-driven content registries`,
after rewriting two of its three claimed costs. #280 `fix(a11y): restore focus to
the opening control when dialogs close`, after supplying the oracle it lacked and
fixing a hole.

**Closed:** #284 `fix(world): enforce strict orthogonal traversals`. The oracle
does not hold. `canTraverse` is documented as "can cross directly between
neighboring cells", and both `pathfinding.ts:97` and `ai.ts:135` expand an
**8-connected** neighborhood and gate each step on it. Manhattan makes every
diagonal return `false`, silently turning click-to-move and monster pathing
4-directional: measured on an open plane, `(0,0)->(5,5)` goes from 6 steps to an
11-step staircase. `Physics.ensureTerrainBoundary` only ever passes east/south,
so nothing actually wants diagonals rejected.

**Found in main:** two things, both in what landed today, both in the Phase 2
pull request.

1. `restoreFocus` guarded with `document.body.contains(opener)`, which answers
   "is it in the document", not "can it take focus". A control inside a dialog
   hidden while another was open is still contained, but `display: none` and
   `disabled` both make `focus()` a silent no-op that leaves focus on `<body>` —
   the exact stranding the module exists to prevent. Now attempts the focus and
   verifies it landed.
2. `sortCommandsDeterministically` had no test. Its `actorId`/`id` tie-breaks are
   load-bearing for netcode and RNG determinism, and dropping either broke no
   test. Now covered, mutation-checked against all three levels.

Also added the exhaustiveness trade-off missing from ADR 0005: `Record<ItemType,
ItemDef>` gives compiler-enforced registry completeness today (verified: a new
enum member with no entry yields `TS2741`), and Option 2 would remove it.

**For next time:**

- **The diagonal-traversal change keeps coming back.** #284 today, and #275,
  #270, #268 before it were all closed unmerged. That is four rejections of the
  same edit. It is a movement **design** question, not a bug; do not re-review it
  from scratch. Related unmerged branches still on origin: `fix-cantraverse-wrapping-*`,
  `fix/world-wrap-traverse-*`, `fix/world-plane-wrap-*`.
- **Re-check the diff immediately before merging a Jules pull request you have
  commented on.** On #280 the integration answered my review by pushing a commit
  that reverted it _and_ deleted #283's already-merged test, because the branch
  had dropped its merge of `main`. Merging would have silently reverted landed
  work, and **CI was green on it** — the suite cannot notice its own tests going
  missing. It was a normal commit, not a force-push, so it was correctable
  forward.
- **Jules log entries keep carrying wrong dates:** #284 wrote `2025-02-15`, #282
  `2024-05-18`, #280 `2026-10-24` (in the future). Corrected on the merged ones.
  Worth fixing in the prompts.
- #281 is not a re-run of #278, which a previous run closed. #278 rested on a
  `types.ts` merge-conflict claim the history contradicted; #281 rests on the
  dialogue relational-integrity gap documented verbatim in
  `dialogue-defs.test.ts`. I removed the merge-conflict claim before merging.
- `npm ci` before trusting `type-check` here: the sandbox had TypeScript 6.0.2
  installed against a lockfile pinning 5.9.3, which fails `main` with a bogus
  `TS5107`. That is the environment, not a red `main`.
- Remote branch deletion is unavailable to this routine (blocked before reaching
  GitHub). Ten merged branches are listed in the run summary for a human.

## 2026-09-21

**Merged:** #292 `perf(net): replace json stringify with structural equality in
state deltas`, after reproducing the measurement and adding the coverage it
lacked. #293 `fix(a11y): add aria-pressed state to character modal toggles`,
as-is. #295 `docs(adr): propose runtime validation for untrusted inputs`, after
correcting a false citation and adding a third option.

**Closed:** #294 `fix(world): reject diagonal traversals in world plane`. Fifth
proposal of the same one-line Manhattan edit after #268, #270, #275, #284. Its
oracle was circular — the "failing test" was one the pull request itself added
asserting the new behaviour.

**Found in main:** nothing defective in the newly merged code. The Phase 2 pull
request closes the coverage gap that reviewing #294 exposed.

**For next time:**

- **The diagonal-traversal edit is now pinned, so it should stop coming back.**
  The reason it kept looking plausible is that nothing covered the contract:
  the whole 834-test suite passed with `canTraverse` switched to Manhattan, so
  every one of the five pull requests could truthfully say "npm test passed."
  `world-plane.test.ts` and `pathfinding.test.ts` now fail under that mutation
  (verified). A sixth proposal should now fail CI rather than need review. Note
  `FlatTileSource.canTraverse` ignores direction entirely, so the pathfinding
  test had to use a `WorldPlane` — a `FlatTileSource` test cannot catch this.

- **An integration push reverted review corrections again — second time.** On
  #292, `e28b98e6` deleted all eleven tests added during review and restored the
  log entry's unscoped claims, leaving the perf change itself untouched. **CI was
  green on it**, because a suite cannot notice its own tests going missing. #280
  did the same on 2026-09-19 and additionally deleted an already-merged test.
  Both were normal commits and correctable forward. Keep re-checking the head
  immediately before merging; a green check on a Jules branch you have
  commented on is not evidence the corrections survived.

- **Second ADR in a row with a citation defect.** #295's 2026-08-30 bullet said
  a numeric `name` field bypassed escaping and crashed the server list.
  `.jules/sentinel.md` says `name` and `host` _were_ escaped and the hole was in
  `phase`/`players`/`maxPlayers`; the 2026-09-02 entry records that exact
  numeric-`name` case as already hardened, asserted by
  `discovery-packet.test.ts:92`. #286 misattributed `invariant.md` entries to
  `bolt.md`. Verify ADR citations against the logs rather than reading them.

- **Bolt's measurement held this time,** which is worth recording after two
  entries whose headline multipliers did not. ~2x reproduced independently
  (637ms to 303-368ms). The framing did not hold: "server tick delays" and
  "massive GC churn" were never demonstrated, and at a realistic ~150 entities
  the saving is ~120us against a 50ms tick. Scoped in `.jules/bolt.md`. When
  reviewing a Bolt entry, check whether the benchmark shares object references
  between baseline and next — the identity short-circuit makes a fake 16x.

- **`.claude/routines/daily-log.md` is also created by #285**, the unmerged
  Phase 2 pull request from 2026-09-19, which carries that run's entry. Whichever
  lands second needs a trivial merge of the two entries. #285 is still open and
  is not a Jules pull request, so this routine left it alone.

- **Branch deletion is still unavailable.** Thirteen merged branches remain on
  origin; `git push origin --delete` answers "Everything up-to-date" and deletes
  nothing. Listed in the run summary for a human.

- **Pre-existing, deliberately not fixed:** `game-menu.ts:469` and `:1231` query
  `document.querySelectorAll("[data-zoom-value]")` document-wide, while
  `CharacterModal` builds its own buttons with that attribute. With both in the
  DOM, GameMenu's sync reaches into the character modal's zoom buttons. Not
  touched by any pull request in this window.
