# Daily curation log

One entry per run of `.claude/routines/daily.md`. Records what was merged,
what was closed and why, and what a later run should check or stop
re-deriving.

## 2026-09-30

**Merged:** #326 `refactor(engine): consolidate duplicate game state init logic`
— extracts the ~25 lines of `GameState` boilerplate shared by
`createInitialState`, `reset`, and `deserialize` into `createBaseState`.
Corrected on the branch before merging (see below).

**Closed:**

- **#324** (diagonal traversal) — the **twelfth** proposal of the same one-line
  narrowing of `WorldPlane.canTraverse` from Chebyshev to Manhattan. Previously
  #263, #268, #270, #275, #284, #288, #294, #298, #300, #315, #320.
- **#325** (wake resting player) — a re-proposal of #321, closed the day before
  with the same stated root cause. Also shipped a 1918-line
  `commands.ts.orig` merge artifact and changed no test.

**Found in main:** nothing defective. The 24-hour window was exactly #326.

**For next time — things a later run should believe without re-deriving:**

1. **`WorldPlane.canTraverse` is deliberately 8-connected.** Both pathfinders
   (`utils/pathfinding.ts`, `systems/simulation/ai.ts`) expand all eight
   neighbours and gate each step on it. Narrowing it to Manhattan silently
   makes click-to-move and monster pathing four-directional. Verified again on
   2026-09-30: with the Manhattan change applied to `main`, **all 97 files /
   852 tests still pass**. "npm test passed" is therefore worth nothing on this
   predicate, which is exactly why the bots keep proposing it. #296 pins the
   contract and would end the cycle; it is still open.

2. **The `REST_TIME_SCALE` leak does not exist.** All three assignments are
   gated on `player.resting`, and `stopPlayerResting` resets both `timeScale`
   and `targetTimeScale` synchronously. Whether an action _should_ interrupt
   rest is a product decision, not a defect. Re-checked on 2026-09-30; the code
   is unchanged since #321 was closed.

3. **There is no `.jules/world.md` or `.jules/alpha.md` learning log.** That is
   the direct cause of 1 and 2 recurring: those bots have nowhere to read their
   own rejections from. #323 adds `world.md` and is still open. Until one lands,
   expect both to be proposed again.

4. **Pin `expectedHeadSha` on every merge.** The 2026-09-25 run lost #309 to a
   stale squash that merged an out-of-date view of #310's branch. #326 was
   merged with the SHA pinned and verified afterwards
   (`git diff origin/main <branch-tip>` empty).

5. **The commit-msg hook rejects any uppercase character anywhere in the
   message**, trailers included (`scripts/validate-commit-message.mjs`). A
   `Claude-Session:` trailer cannot be added locally without failing it, since
   lowercasing the URL breaks the link. Squash-merge titles set through the API
   bypass the hook, which is why `main`'s history contains mixed-case bodies.

6. **Branch deletion still 403s.** `git push origin --delete` fails with HTTP
   403 and the `mcp__github__*` toolset has no branch-deletion tool. 39 merged
   branches are deletable and could not be removed; 56 unmerged leftovers from
   closed pull requests must be left for a human either way. One attempt is
   enough to confirm — do not retry.
