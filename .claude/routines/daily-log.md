# Daily Curation Log

Appended by the daily routine (`.claude/routines/daily.md`). Newest last.

## 2026-09-21

**Merged:** #292 `perf(net): replace json stringify with structural equality in
state deltas`, after reproducing the measurement and adding the coverage it
lacked. #293 `fix(a11y): add aria-pressed state to character modal toggles`,
as-is. #295 `docs(adr): propose runtime validation for untrusted inputs`, after
correcting a false citation and adding a third option.

**Closed:** #294 `fix(world): reject diagonal traversals in world plane`. Fifth
proposal of the same one-line Manhattan edit after #268, #270, #275, #284. Its
oracle was circular — the "failing test" was one the pull request itself added
asserting the new behaviour.

**Found in main:** nothing defective in the newly merged code. The Phase 2 pull
request closes the coverage gap that reviewing #294 exposed.

**For next time:**

- **The diagonal-traversal edit is now pinned, so it should stop coming back.**
  The reason it kept looking plausible is that nothing covered the contract:
  the whole 834-test suite passed with `canTraverse` switched to Manhattan, so
  every one of the five pull requests could truthfully say "npm test passed."
  `world-plane.test.ts` and `pathfinding.test.ts` now fail under that mutation
  (verified). A sixth proposal should now fail CI rather than need review. Note
  `FlatTileSource.canTraverse` ignores direction entirely, so the pathfinding
  test had to use a `WorldPlane` — a `FlatTileSource` test cannot catch this.

- **An integration push reverted review corrections again — second time.** On
  #292, `e28b98e6` deleted all eleven tests added during review and restored the
  log entry's unscoped claims, leaving the perf change itself untouched. **CI was
  green on it**, because a suite cannot notice its own tests going missing. #280
  did the same on 2026-09-19 and additionally deleted an already-merged test.
  Both were normal commits and correctable forward. Keep re-checking the head
  immediately before merging; a green check on a Jules branch you have
  commented on is not evidence the corrections survived.

- **Second ADR in a row with a citation defect.** #295's 2026-08-30 bullet said
  a numeric `name` field bypassed escaping and crashed the server list.
  `.jules/sentinel.md` says `name` and `host` _were_ escaped and the hole was in
  `phase`/`players`/`maxPlayers`; the 2026-09-02 entry records that exact
  numeric-`name` case as already hardened, asserted by
  `discovery-packet.test.ts:92`. #286 misattributed `invariant.md` entries to
  `bolt.md`. Verify ADR citations against the logs rather than reading them.

- **Bolt's measurement held this time,** which is worth recording after two
  entries whose headline multipliers did not. ~2x reproduced independently
  (637ms to 303-368ms). The framing did not hold: "server tick delays" and
  "massive GC churn" were never demonstrated, and at a realistic ~150 entities
  the saving is ~120us against a 50ms tick. Scoped in `.jules/bolt.md`. When
  reviewing a Bolt entry, check whether the benchmark shares object references
  between baseline and next — the identity short-circuit makes a fake 16x.

- **`.claude/routines/daily-log.md` is also created by #285**, the unmerged
  Phase 2 pull request from 2026-09-19, which carries that run's entry. Whichever
  lands second needs a trivial merge of the two entries. #285 is still open and
  is not a Jules pull request, so this routine left it alone.

- **Branch deletion is still unavailable.** Thirteen merged branches remain on
  origin; `git push origin --delete` answers "Everything up-to-date" and deletes
  nothing. Listed in the run summary for a human.

- **Pre-existing, deliberately not fixed:** `game-menu.ts:469` and `:1231` query
  `document.querySelectorAll("[data-zoom-value]")` document-wide, while
  `CharacterModal` builds its own buttons with that attribute. With both in the
  DOM, GameMenu's sync reaches into the character modal's zoom buttons. Not
  touched by any pull request in this window.
