# Daily Curation Log

Appended to by `.claude/routines/daily.md`, one entry per run. Records what was
merged, what was closed and why, and what a later run should check or believe.

## 2026-09-23

**Merged:**

- **#303** `refactor(simulation): consolidate portal transition checks in commands` —
  Janitor. Real duplication: `resolveDescendCommand` and `resolveAscendCommand`
  had identical portal-lookup bodies. Fixed on the branch before merging: the
  extracted helper returned `string | undefined` while being named for a portal,
  and both call sites used a falsy check on it; it now returns
  `WorldPortal | null`. Also replaced `any` parameters on the new
  `fireReloadCommand` test helper with real types.
- **#301** `docs(client): document retromodal focus management contract` —
  Scribe. The constructor comment at `retro-modal.ts:45-53` explained what the
  component deliberately does not do, but never the caller's obligation, and as
  an inline comment it never reached IntelliSense. Fixed on the branch: the
  contract as written said to capture the opener before _every_ `show()`, which
  is the trap. Callers must skip the capture when the dialog is already open
  (`game-menu.ts:1462-1464`).

**Closed:**

- **#300** `fix(engine): prevent invalid diagonal cell traversals` — the **eighth**
  proposal of the identical `Math.max` -> Manhattan edit in
  `WorldPlane.canTraverse`, after #268, #270, #275, #284, #288, #294, #298.
  The 8-connected neighbourhood is deliberate: `pathfinding.ts:80-108` and
  `ai.ts:133-148` both expand all eight neighbours and gate each step on
  `canTraverse`. Measured directly rather than argued — on an open 8x8 plane,
  `findPath (1,1)->(5,5)` goes from 5 diagonal steps to a 9-step L-shaped
  detour. The body's claim that AI pathfinding was "audited and determined safe"
  is false.
- **#302** `docs(adr): propose extracting simulation pipeline limits` — Architect.
  Oracle fails. The Context claimed there is "no uniform mechanism for ...
  logging"; both sites already `console.error` (`events.ts:70-72`,
  `tick.ts:90-94`). Its headline benefit — per-build-variant tuning of
  `MAX_EVENTS_PER_TICK` / `MAX_COMMANDS_PER_TICK` — contradicts
  `ARCHITECTURE.md:25-26` ("The same engine runs offline, in the Electron
  client, and on the authoritative server") and would break determinism, since
  `tick.ts:89-94` truncates before sorting so which commands survive changes the
  resulting state.

**Found in main:** the descend/ascend command path had **no test coverage at
all**. Making `getTransitionPortal` return `null` unconditionally — which
disables every stairway in the game — left all 845 tests passing. So did
dropping the `"No stairs here."` alert, the player-kind guard, and the
`descendTarget = undefined` reset. #303 made this sharper by routing both
commands through one helper. Covered by `level-transitions.test.ts` in this
pull request.

**For next time:**

- **Stop re-reviewing the diagonal-traversal edit.** Eight closes. It is a
  product decision about how the game moves, not a defect. #296 (open) pins the
  contract; landing it would end the cycle at the source. Until then, close on
  sight and cite this entry.
- **`npm test` passing proves little about `canTraverse` and proved nothing
  about descend/ascend.** Both were entirely uncovered. Treat a bot's "tests
  pass, no regressions" as unverified for these paths.
- **Believe:** branch deletion is blocked in this environment. `git push origin
--delete` fails identically on every branch (remote hangs up). Attempt once,
  list the rest, move on. `delete_branch_on_merge` does work for most merges,
  but `refactor-simulation-commands-6932021227322539262` survived its own merge
  this run — a human can remove it.
- **Check:** the repo's commit-msg hook (`scripts/validate-commit-message.mjs`)
  rejects _any_ uppercase in the whole message, including inside identifiers and
  URLs. A `Claude-Session:` trailer cannot be committed here. Write commit
  bodies fully lowercase.
- **Not acted on, no oracle:** `tick.ts:89-94` truncates `aiCommands` _before_
  `sortCommandsDeterministically`, so overflow drops commands in generation
  order rather than lowest-priority-first. Arguably the wrong order, but nothing
  shows the 1000 limit is ever reached.
