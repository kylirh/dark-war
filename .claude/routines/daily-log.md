# Daily Curator Log

Appended to by `.claude/routines/daily.md`. Each entry covers one run, both
phases. A later run should read this before re-litigating a decision.

**Merged:** #309 `fix(net): round-trip levels through state delta compression`
and #310 `docs(adr): propose deterministic simulation budgets`. Both needed
corrective commits first.

#309's oracle holds — reverting only `src/net/state-delta.ts` and keeping the
new test reproduces the failure. Two things are worth believing about it rather
than re-deriving:

- Its body frames this as a live multiplayer bug. It is not. The server migrates
  players between separate `LevelWorld` games via `detachPlayer` /
  `attachExistingPlayer` and never calls `Game.descend()` / `ascend()`, which are
  the only callers of the private `saveCurrentLevelSnapshot()`. A server-side
  `Game` therefore keeps `levels` empty and serializes `[]`. It was merged as a
  contract fix — `state-delta.ts:16` already named `levels` as a delta-carried
  field — not as a bug fix. The added comparison is free in the hot path for the
  same reason (`shallowJsonEqual([], [])` exits on the length check).
- Its claim that no other `SerializedState` field is omitted checks out. `sim`,
  `effects`, `sounds`, `alerts` and `callouts` are absent from the optional-field
  handling because they are _required_ on `StateDelta` and sent every delta, per
  the comment at `state-delta.ts:72`. Do not "fix" those.

Corrections pushed: the learning-log heading was a literal `$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`,
and the round-trip test was equally satisfied by assigning `delta.levels`
unconditionally, which would have put every visited level on the wire each tick.

#310 asserted that both safety limits "stop and defer the rest to the next
tick". True for events, false for commands — `tick.ts:89-95` truncates
`aiCommands` outright and `generateAICommands` rebuilds the list next tick, so
the excess is dropped, not queued. The Consequences section had inherited the
error. Corrected, and recorded the cost it had missed: truncation runs _before_
`sortCommandsDeterministically`, so the surviving 1000 are the earliest
generated, not the highest priority.

**Closed:** nothing. Only two Jules pull requests were open and both were
salvageable. No duplicate groups this run.

**Found in main:** one real defect, in the Phase 2 pull request. Pressing
ascend while standing on a _downward_ staircase moved the player deeper.
`getTransitionPortal` accepted any portal of kind stairs/ladder/cave-mouth/door
for both commands, so `resolveAscendCommand` happily took the down-stairs'
portal and `Game.ascend()` followed its destination. Reproduced at depth 1 after
a round trip to depth 2 (the destination snapshot must be resident, or
`Game.ascend()` bails on the missing snapshot and masks it). Fixed by rejecting
a portal whose depth change opposes the command.

**For next time:**

- The direction guard deliberately exempts portals whose destination has no
  depth (`depthForWorldAddress` returns `null` for `caves` / `settlement`) and
  portals on the current depth. The outside cave mouth and workshop door are
  both depth 0 and are entered through these same two commands, so a strict
  `>` / `<` check without those exemptions breaks them. There is a regression
  test for exactly that; do not "simplify" it away.
- The wrong-direction case reuses the existing `"No stairs here."` alert, which
  reads oddly while standing on stairs. New player-facing copy is a product
  decision and was left alone — same conclusion #304 reached about the ascend
  wording. Stop re-reporting it as a defect.
- `.claude/routines/daily-log.md` is created by four open pull requests now
  (#285, #296, #304, and this run's). Whichever lands second onwards needs a
  trivial merge of entries. Earlier entries were not copied in, since that
  content belongs to pull requests still awaiting review.
- Branch deletion is still 403 from this environment, and so is
  `git push origin --delete`. Pushing commits works. One throwaway ref,
  `claude/push-capability-test-20260925`, was created by the routine's mandated
  push test and could not be deleted; a human may remove it.
